 * In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are

 *     1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).
 * 
 * It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
 * 
 *     1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p
 * 
 * How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
