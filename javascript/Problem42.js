/*
 * The n^th term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, t[n] = Â½n(n+1);
 * so the first ten triangle numbers are:
 * 
 * 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
 * 
 * By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
 * alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For
 * example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t[10]. If the word value
 * is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
 * 
 * Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file
 * containing nearly two-thousand common English words, how many are triangle
 * words?
