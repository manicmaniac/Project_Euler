In England the currency is made up of pound, Â£, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, Â£1 (100p) and Â£2 (200p).
It is possible to make Â£2 in the following way:

1Â£1 + 150p + 220p + 15p + 12p + 31p
How many different ways can Â£2 be made using any number of coins?
